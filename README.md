# nodestorm

nodestorm is a Svelte component library that provides a Graph component in which node flows can be created.

Custom nodes can be created with inputs and outputs. Every node has a method that can update their outputs whenever their inputs are updated, creating a performant network of reactive node components.

Work in progress :)
